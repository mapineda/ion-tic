# Ion-tic
Tic-tac-toe goes mobile with ionic/cordova

## Get Started:

## Requirements:

* Implement basic logic: turn-based logic, win calculation, no playing a square that is already occupied, etc.
* Assume 2 human players (no AI)
* Build a 3x3 board size for the UI; win logic should support an NxN board size

### Methodology:

* Mobile-first
* Lean UX Design Process
* Test

#### Lean UX Design
Assumptions:
Business Assumptions
* Customers have a need to compete and interact with each other

* These needs can be solved with a mobile mini-game

* My initial customer will be public transit commuters with smartphones

* No 1 value my customer wants to get out of my service is entertainment

* Additional benefits to customer is a sense of community, acceptance and interaction with others

User Assumptions
* The user are millenials with smartphones(android devices) who use public transit to commute

* This product fits in between their 'living space' and 'work space'

* The product is used when users commute from place to place or while they are waiting to use public transit

* Important features: quick login, custom profile(avatar), player matchup, save gaming record on a public leaderboard

* Product should borrow the color-scheme of a connect-four game and behave like a traditional tic-tac-toe game

Hypothesis: Millenials want to play 1v1 games on their smartphone without a lengthy sign-up process.

Outcomes:
* k-factor
* Daily-active-users (DAU)
* Retention
* New Users
* Average session length
* Average session/user
